# NYC-Public-School-Test-Result-Scores

Introduction
Every year, American high school students take SATs, which are standardized tests intended to measure literacy, numeracy, and writing skills. The SAT scores play a pivotal role in the admissions process for colleges and universities. Analyzing the performance of schools on the SATs is crucial for various stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government entities, and parents who are considering school options for their children.

This project focuses on analyzing the performance of public schools in New York City using SAT data. The dataset includes information about schools, such as the school name, borough, building code, average math score, average reading score, average writing score, and the percentage of students who completed the SATs.
